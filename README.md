# titanic-prediction-app

This simple and fun app is built with Python, Django, Machine Learning, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is based on the purpolar Titanic data set.
So I wanted to turn it into a game/app that could tell/predict if a user would survive if they were in the titanic.
Using Age, Sex, Class and number of siblings on board as criterials to predict..
I have a pickled random forest model with over 85% accuracy. And also each prediction is saved in a CSV file.
